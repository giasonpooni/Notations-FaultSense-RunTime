## Organization

**Notation Systems Inc** is the parent organization: a scientific computing and systems engineering company developing computational instruments, software and interactive environments for understanding and building physical and virtual systems.

The company's development direction connects measurement, state estimation and sensor fusion, scientific modelling, simulation and execution, from materials and machines to interactive worlds.

| Division | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| **Notations Gaming** | Games, graphics, world building, interactive environments and gameplay simulation. |
| **Notations Manufacturing** | Design, machinery integration, process development, fabrication and production systems. |
| **Notations Laboratories** | Research and experimental validation in scientific computing, measurement, physics and chemistry modelling, materials and simulation. |

**Repository role:** Fault Monitor contributes residual and change detection to **Notations Laboratories**, supporting diagnostic work for **Notations Manufacturing**. Its statistical outputs can inform broader state estimation workflows; an anomaly is not a confirmed physical fault or permission to control machinery.

## Instrument role

**Notation Systems — Frontier Tooling and Instrumentation for Digital Futures.** FaultSense provides residual statistics and explicit diagnostic transitions, not physical fault confirmation or equipment control. [Notations Systems Terminal](https://github.com/atomtrapping/Notations-Systems-Terminal) coordinates supported workflows while this provider retains its mathematics.

The current repository is `Notations-FaultSense-RunTime`; FDIR / `fdir`, existing status codes and historical contracts remain. The firm's operational products and Notations Gaming' creative/IP projects retain separate state, evidence and release authority. [Current organization](#organization).

| NET micro-tool | Identity and scope |
| --- | --- |
| User-facing name | **FaultSense** (historical display: Fault Monitor) |
| Proposed NET operation family | `diagnostics.faults` |
| Implementation repository | `Notations-FaultSense-RunTime` |
| Existing provider and import | Fault Detection and Isolation Runtime / FDIR; `fdir` |
| Existing operations | `evaluate_residual` and `cusum_step` |
| Current boundary | Statistical anomaly detection; physical fault confirmation and cause isolation are not implemented |

`diagnostics.faults` is the agreed NET-facing target, **not a newly installed
command, automatic diagnosis service or live equipment-control adapter**. Use
the standalone functions and examples below. A threshold crossing is an anomaly,
not proof of a broken component; a nominal result is not proof of correct operation.

NET owns session composition and dispatch; this provider owns residual statistics
and explicit CUSUM transitions. Callers own the chosen scalar stream and prior
monitor state. Evidence, operation specifications, execution attempts and
verification records remain distinct. Imports, contracts, existing status codes
and licence terms are unchanged.

FDIR is a bounded statistical diagnostics instrument. It evaluates estimator innovations and scalar residual streams, preserving the inputs, their declared identities, the chosen thresholds, and each sequential transition. The current foundation implements anomaly detection; **physical fault confirmation and cause isolation are not implemented**.

The `fdir` Python package provides:

| Operation | Implemented behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `evaluate_residual` | Cholesky whitening, marginal normalization, normalized innovation squared (NIS), and explicit threshold comparison |
| `cusum_step` | Pure positive, negative, or two-sided CUSUM transition with explicit prior state, drift, threshold, and optional post-alarm reset |

Outputs use `nominal` and `statistical_anomaly`. A `nominal` result means the chosen test did not cross its threshold on that input; it does not prove correct operation. An anomaly does not identify a failed sensor, prove a physical defect, or authorize an action.

## Two explicit diagnostic operations

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    I["Innovation and covariance"] --> W["Whitening and NIS"]
    W --> G{"NIS at or above threshold?"}
    T["Caller threshold"] --> G
    G -- "yes" --> A["Statistical anomaly"]
    G -- "no" --> N["Nominal"]
    X["Declared scalar sample"] --> C["Pure CUSUM transition"]
    P["Prior state and policy"] --> C
    C --> R["Status, observed state and next state"]
```

Solid arrows show the two current local APIs. The package does not automatically
feed NIS or a selected residual component into CUSUM: the caller defines the
scalar stream and supplies its prior state. Both outputs are statistical
diagnostics; neither path establishes physical fault isolation or authorizes
an equipment action. See the [system diagram atlas](https://github.com/atomtrapping/Notations-Systems-Terminal/blob/main/docs/DIAGRAMS.md).

## Install and run

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest -q
python examples/replay.py
```

The replay uses fixed fixtures and emits JSON without timestamps, random identifiers, network access, or persistent state.

```python
from fdir import evaluate_residual

result = evaluate_residual(
    residual=[2.0, 3.0],
    innovation_covariance=[[4.0, 2.0], [2.0, 5.0]],
    threshold=4.0,
    variable_order=["position_x_m", "position_y_m"],
    source_ids=["innovation:fixture:1"],
)
assert result.whitened_residual == (1.0, 1.0)
assert result.nis == 2.0
assert result.status == "nominal"
```

Thresholds are caller-supplied. The instrument makes no automatic chi-square calibration, confidence-level, false-alarm-rate, or detection-probability claim.

## System role

GSIE can provide innovations and their innovation covariance. FDIR computes diagnostics over those inputs. SET retains offline evaluation and benchmarking; Notations Systems Terminal (CIW) can display and inspect diagnostic records. FDIR does not change estimator state, remove observations, shut down sensors, admit evidence, or issue controls. See [STACK_ROLE.md](STACK_ROLE.md).

This repository provides standalone functions and a synthetic replay. The GSIE, SET, and CIW positions describe ownership boundaries; this release does not contain live adapters to those repositories.

## Existing result exchange

An optional export helper maps explicitly supplied values into SET's existing `notation.instrument.result-artifact.v1` contract and calls the source-pinned SET validator:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test,exchange]'
python examples/exchange.py
```

The example exports NIS as a dimensionless scalar diagnostic, with score covariance `not_applicable`, and retains the full input innovation covariance and residual diagnostics inside the computation record. It uses a synthetic all-zero revision and explicit timestamp; neither is an attestation. Result, operation, execution, and source references remain distinct; no verification record is fabricated. This demonstrates exchange conformance, not native execution in CIW or independent scientific verification.

See [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md) for validated inputs and transition semantics and [docs/NUMERICS.md](docs/NUMERICS.md) for equations, numerical limits, and analytical verification.

## Research profile

**Question:** what does a statistical disagreement establish, and what remains ambiguous? The current innovation and CUSUM specimens let the programme test threshold behavior, covariance assumptions, sequence history and retained diagnostic state.

Future evaluation should distinguish simulated ground truth, measured observations and expert hypotheses; report false alarms and missed detections only against a defined labelled reference. A detector's output is not a root-cause finding. Measure end-to-end cost and rework without promoting unknown telemetry to zero.

[Historical research protocol](https://github.com/atomtrapping/Notations-Systems-Terminal/blob/b41b84922d4963a9206202029afd1e78b9451f9c/RESEARCH_PROGRAMME.md). General inference, new language providers and CUDA acceleration remain separate work. This documentation changes no numerical implementation, tests, thresholds, permissions or release status and reports no new qualification run.
